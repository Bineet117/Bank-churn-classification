# Bank Churn Prediction

This project predicts customer churn using a **Streamlit-based web app**. The model leverages customer information to identify whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.

### Features
- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
- Predicts churn probability based on user inputs.
- Real-time predictions using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.

### App URL
Access the deployed app here: [Bank Churn Prediction](https://bank-churn-classification.streamlit.app/)
